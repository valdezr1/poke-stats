PokeStats allows a user to type in a Pokemon by ID number or by Name. 
It grabs data from the PokeAPI (http://pokeapi.co/) and charts the base statistics of the requested Pokemon into an interactive polar chart. 
This application was created primarily using React (https://facebook.github.io/react/) and ChartJS (http://www.chartjs.org/).
