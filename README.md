# PokeStats

Project deployed through the following link: https://valdezr1.github.io/poke-stats/

PokeStats allows a user to type in a Pokemon by ID number or by Name and view its base statistics. <br/>

By sending requests to a the RESTful Web Service (PokeAPI: http://pokeapi.co/) based on user input, PokeStats charts the base statistics into an interactive polar chart. This application works well, on both mobile and desktop devices. <br/>

This application was created primarily using React.js and ChartJS.
